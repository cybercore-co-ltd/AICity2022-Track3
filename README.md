# ccaction
This project is developed by Cybercore AI for AI City Challenge 2022 Track 3.
The project is based on the open source [mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2)

# Installation
## Environment Setup
a. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

```shell
conda create -n aicity_t3 python=3.7 -y
conda activate aicity_t3
```

b. Install PyTorch and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/), e.g.,

```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```
Note: Make sure that your compilation CUDA version and runtime CUDA version match.
You can check the supported CUDA version for precompiled packages on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

`E.g.1` If you have CUDA 10.2 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install PyTorch 1.5,
you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 10.2.

```shell
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 torchvision -c pytorch
```
## Install MMAction2
Install MMAction2 with [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim).

```shell
pip install openmim
mim install mmaction2==0.17.0
```
MIM can automatically install OpenMMLab projects and their requirements.

## Install CCAction package
```shell
python setup.py develop
```
